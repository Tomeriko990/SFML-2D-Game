# SFML-2D-Game

## Description

This is an ongoing project for a 2D game built using **SFML** (Simple and Fast Multimedia Library) in C++. The game features dynamic gameplay with a modular design, focusing on character movement, animation, and interaction within a grid-based map environment. The project is currently in development and is not yet finished. New features and improvements are actively being added.

## Features (Planned and In Progress)

- **Grid-based Map**: The game world is constructed on a grid system, allowing for flexible level design and tile-based interactions.
- **Player Movement**: The player can move the character with smooth animations and transitions.
- **Arrow Shooting**: Players can shoot arrows as part of the gameplay mechanics.
- **Modular Architecture**: The project follows a component-based approach, making it easy to extend and modify the game logic.
- **Ongoing Development**: New features, bug fixes, and optimizations are continuously being worked on.

## Technologies Used

- **SFML**: Simple and Fast Multimedia Library for handling graphics, window management, and input.
- **C++**: The primary programming language used for development.
- **Git**: Version control system used for tracking changes and collaboration.

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Tomeriko990/SFML-2D-Game.git
2. Install SFML and any required dependencies (make sure to set up SFML correctly for your platform).

3.Build the project using a C++ compiler (e.g., g++, clang++), and ensure proper linking with SFML libraries.

4.Run the executable to start playing. Keep in mind that the project is still under development, so some features may not be fully functional yet.
